okay, so I decided to try to make a game in pure c++ and raylib and uhh.. that's what i made  
shit

currently there are only 24 entity modifiers and 1 type, errant. and 4 player edicts (abilities), and parry (and infinite player levels), and.. idk, just let me know if it even works 4 you

-- controls --  
esc - pause  
wasd - move  
double tap wasd - short dash  
shift - sprint  
double tap shift - dash  
f - parry (press before taking damage to avoid it, or combine with walking | dashing into errants to deal massive damage)  
left click - slash (starter edict)  
right click - beam (starter edict)  
q - spark (5+ level, hold)  
e - slayer of atoms (15+ level, 3 stacks, each stack regenerates every 10 seconds. can be held to slow down the game & aim your cursor)  

oh and also, if you want a cool aim line, press ctrl+l to toggle it


huge shoutout to RundownSD for making non-copyright banger music!! i used one of his songs, VOID STAR, as temporary stage 5 insanity music (aka 66% green thing on your insanity bar). you can listen to his music here: https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCiVv5-44os4P_hzeZTk816Q  
and for the base insanity stages (1-4), i used this song as yet another temporary music: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=DufHA8k4N9U&si=EllQpk6GwvnwU9tM

if I used any of your content that you want to get removed, please let me know! I will remove it from the game without any hesitation
