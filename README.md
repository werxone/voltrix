okay so i decided to try to make a game in pure c++ and uhh that's what i made

shit

currently there are only 24 entity modifiers and 1 type, errant. and 4 player edicts (abilities), and parry (and infinite player levels), and.. idk just tell me if it even works 4 you

-- controls --
wasd - move
double tap wasd - short dash
shift - sprint
double tap shift - dash
f - parry (press before taking damage to avoid it, or combine with walking | dashing into errants to deal massive damage)
left click - slash (starter edict)
right click - beam (starter edict)
q - spark (5+ level, hold)
e - slayer of atoms (15+ level, 3 stacks, each stack regenerates every 10 seconds)
